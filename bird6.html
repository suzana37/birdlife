<p>Doves and pigeons are family members of columbidae. There are about 310 species of doves available. These are considered as symbols of love. They weigh about 900g-2.1 kg. The length of their body ranges for adult male 55cm, 70cm for western crowned pigeon and 13-15 cm for the dwarf. Clutch size is about only 1. Its prey includes seed or fruit. They live mostly in tropical nature and woodlands and are adjustable to any nature. Incubation is done by both parents. Male birds make woo-hoo sounds to indicate they are single.
